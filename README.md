# [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)
I found out about Advent of Code recently, and I thought it'd be a good 
opportunity to practice C++. Plus, it's festive and that's fun.

<br>These challenges remind me of the kinda stuff I'd have to do for homework
in highschool, in like a good way. Fun little coding exercises :)

## Navigation
It should be pretty intuitive. Each day has its own folder, and in each
folder is at least one .cpp file with the code, along with input.txt for the
challenge input.
